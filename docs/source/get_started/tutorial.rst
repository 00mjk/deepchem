Tutorials
=========

If you're new to DeepChem, you probably want to know the basics. What is DeepChem? 
Why should you care about using it? The short answer is that DeepChem is a scientific machine learning library. 
(The "Chem" indicates the historical fact that DeepChem initially focused on chemical applications,
but we aim to support all types of scientific applications more broadly).

Why would you want to use DeepChem instead of another machine learning
library? Simply put, DeepChem maintains an extensive collection of utilities
to enable scientific deep learning including classes for loading scientific
datasets, processing them, transforming them, splitting them up, and learning
from them. Behind the scenes DeepChem uses a variety of other machine
learning frameworks such as `scikit-learn`_, `TensorFlow`_, and `XGBoost`_. We are
also experimenting with adding additional models implemented in `PyTorch`_
and `JAX`_. Our focus is to facilitate scientific experimentation using
whatever tools are available at hand.

DeepChem maintains an extensive collection of addition `tutorials`_ that are meant to be run on `Google colab`_,
an online platform that allows you to execute Jupyter notebooks. DeepChem is a big library so we won't cover everything,
but we should give you enough to get started. We show the first 10 tutorials.

1. `Basic Tools of the Deep Life Sciences`_
2. `Working with Datasets`_
3. `MoleculeNet`_
4. `Molecular Fingerprints`_
5. `Creating Models with TensorFlow and PyTorch`_
6. `Graph Convolutions`_
7. `Featurizers`_
8. `Splitters`_
9. `Advanced Model Training`_
10. `Creating Datasets`_
