    "# Tutorial 1: The Basic Tools of the Deep Life Sciences\n",
    "Welcome to DeepChem's introductory tutorial for the deep life sciences. This series of notebooks is step-by-step guide for you to get to know the new tools and techniques needed to do deep learning for the life sciences. We'll start from the basics, assuming that you're new to machine learning and the life sciences, and build up a repertoire of tools and techniques that you can use to do meaningful work in the life sciences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scope:** This tutorial will encompass both the machine learning and data handling needed to build systems for the deep life sciences.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Colab\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial and the rest in the sequences are designed to be done in Google colab. If you'd like to open this notebook in colab, you can use the following link.\n",
    "\n",
    "[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepchem/deepchem/blob/master/examples/tutorials/01_The_Basic_Tools_of_the_Deep_Life_Sciences.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why do the DeepChem Tutorial?\n",
    "\n",
    "**1) Career Advancement:** Applying AI in the life sciences is a booming\n",
    "industry at present. There are a host of newly funded startups and initiatives\n",
    "at large pharmaceutical and biotech companies centered around AI. Learning and\n",
    "mastering DeepChem will bring you to the forefront of this field and will\n",
    "prepare you to enter a career in this field.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2) Humanitarian Considerations:** Disease is the oldest cause of human\n",
    "suffering. From the dawn of human civilization, humans have suffered from pathogens,\n",
    "cancers, and neurological conditions. One of the greatest achievements of\n",
    "the last few centuries has been the development of effective treatments for\n",
    "many diseases. By mastering the skills in this tutorial, you will be able to\n",
    "stand on the shoulders of the giants of the past to help develop new\n",
    "medicine.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3) Lowering the Cost of Medicine:** The art of developing new medicine is\n",
    "currently an elite skill that can only be practiced by a small core of expert\n",
    "practitioners. By enabling the growth of open source tools for drug discovery,\n",
    "you can help democratize these skills and open up drug discovery to more\n",
    "competition. Increased competition can help drive down the cost of medicine.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Extra Credit\n",
    "If you're excited about DeepChem and want to get more more involved, there's a couple of things that you can do right now:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Star DeepChem on GitHub! - https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem\n",
    "* Join the DeepChem forums and introduce yourself! - https://forum.deepchem.io\n",
    "* Say hi on the DeepChem gitter - https://gitter.im/deepchem/Lobby\n",
    "* Make a YouTube video teaching the contents of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will assume some basic familiarity with the Python data science ecosystem. We will assume that you have familiarity with libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, and TensorFlow. We'll provide some brief refreshers on basics through the tutorial so don't worry if you're not an expert.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to get DeepChem up and running. We recommend using Google Colab to work through this tutorial series. You'll need to run the following commands to get DeepChem installed on your colab notebook. Note that this will take something like 5 minutes to run on your colab instance."
