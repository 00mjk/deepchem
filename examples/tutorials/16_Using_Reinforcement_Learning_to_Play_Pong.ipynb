    "This notebook demonstrates using reinforcement learning to train an agent to play Pong.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to create an `Environment` that implements this task.  Fortunately,\n",
    "OpenAI Gym already provides an implementation of Pong (and many other tasks appropriate\n",
    "for reinforcement learning).  DeepChem's `GymEnvironment` class provides an easy way to\n",
    "use environments from OpenAI Gym.  We could just use it directly, but in this case we\n",
    "subclass it and preprocess the screen image a little bit to make learning easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install `gym` you should use `pip install 'gym[atari]'` (We need the extra modifier since we'll be using an atari game). We'll add this command onto our usual Colab installation commands for you"
